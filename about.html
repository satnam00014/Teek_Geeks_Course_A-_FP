                        It has been said that without change, progress would be impossible.

                        Our academic programming also experienced a transformation with the introduction of hybrid
                        learning models designed
                        to
                        provide a flexible education that allows students to personalize their post-secondary journey.
                        Whether you’re a high
                        school graduate looking for a well-rounded college experience, or a busy professional looking to
                        upskill as life
                        allows,
                        Lambton College has a program model that is going to work for you.

                        Our College has also grown tremendously in recent years. Our campus footprint has changed
                        dramatically with the
                        addition
                        of two new buildings – the NOVA Chemicals Health & Research Centre and the Cestar Group
                        Athletics & Fitness Complex
                        –
                        and is home to a growing and diverse student population that is welcoming and inclusive of every
                        person who chooses
                        to
                        study here.
